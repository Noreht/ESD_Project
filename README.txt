README â€“ Instagram Content Organiser (IS213 ESD Project)

This is the source code repository for our IS213 Enterprise Solution Development project titled "Instagram Content Organiser".

The project is designed to help users save and organise video content from Instagram. Key features include:
- User login via Firebase
- Video saving and categorisation
- Display of top 5 categories recently saved
- Shared album functionality with other users
- Notification system (via email, SMS, or frontend alert)

This project is implemented using Python microservices, RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging, Firebase for authentication, and optionally OutSystems for interfacing with legacy systems. We also applied the Strangler Fig Pattern to migrate functionality progressively from OutSystems to our microservices.
